# ML project - Predicting good tippers among taxi clients
In this scenario, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.

## Purpose and Goal
The purpose of this model is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
The goal of this model is to predict whether or not a customer is a generous tipper.
## Technique
In this activity, we will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class. In particular, we will use ensemble learning techniques, namely, Random Forest and XGBoost, using Python.

## Note on Data
This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.
